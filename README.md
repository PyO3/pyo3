[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) bindings for [Python](https://www.python.org/), including tools for creating native Python extension modules. Running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary is also supported.

## Usage

Requires Rust 1.63 or greater.

PyO3 supports the following Python distributions:
  - CPython 3.7 or greater
  - PyPy 7.3 (Python 3.9+)
  - GraalPy 24.0 or greater (Python 3.10+)

You can use PyO3 to write a native Python module in Rust, or to embed Python in a Rust binary. The following sections explain each of these in turn.

### Using Rust from Python

PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module. The easiest way to try this out for the first time is to use [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). `maturin` is a tool for building and publishing Rust-based Python packages with minimal configuration. The following steps install `maturin`, use it to generate and build a new Python package, and then launch Python to import and execute a function from the package.

First, follow the commands below to create a new directory containing a new Python `virtualenv`, and install `maturin` into the virtualenv using Python's package manager, `pip`:

```bash
# (replace string_sum with the desired package name)
$ mkdir string_sum
$ cd string_sum
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install maturin
```

Still inside this `string_sum` directory, now run `maturin init`. This will generate the new package source. When given the choice of bindings to use, select pyo3 bindings:

```bash
$ maturin init
âœ” ðŸ¤· What kind of bindings to use? Â· pyo3
  âœ¨ Done! New project created string_sum
```

The most important files generated by this command are `Cargo.toml` and `lib.rs`, which will look roughly like the following:

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name = "string_sum"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_sum`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = "string_sum"
# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_sum;` unless the "rlib" or "lib" crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.23.3", features = ["extension-module"] }
```

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
#[pyfunction]
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -> PyResult<String> {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this function must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pymodule]
fn string_sum(m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Finally, run `maturin develop`. This will build the package and install it into the Python virtualenv previously created and activated. The package is then ready to be used from `python`:

```bash
$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
>>> import string_sum
>>> string_sum.sum_as_string(5, 20)
'25'
```

To make changes to the package, just edit the Rust source code and then re-run `maturin develop` to recompile.

To run this all as a single copy-and-paste, use the bash script below (replace `string_sum` in the first command with the desired package name):

```bash
mkdir string_sum && cd "$_"
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin init --bindings pyo3
maturin develop
```

If you want to be able to run `cargo test` or use this project in a Cargo workspace and are running into linker issues, there are some workarounds in [the FAQ](https://pyo3.rs/latest/faq.html#i-cant-run-cargo-test-or-i-cant-build-in-a-cargo-workspace-im-having-linker-issues-like-symbol-not-found-or-undefined-reference-to-_pyexc_systemerror).

As well as with `maturin`, it is possible to build using [`setuptools-rust`](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) or [manually](https://pyo3.rs/latest/building-and-distribution.html#manual-builds). Both offer more flexibility than `maturin` but require more configuration to get started.

### Using Python from Rust

To embed Python into a Rust binary, you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library. The following steps demonstrate how to ensure this (for Ubuntu), and then give some example code which runs an embedded Python interpreter.

To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

To install the Python shared library on RPM based distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SuSE), install the `python3-devel` package.


Start a new project with `cargo new` and add  `pyo3` to the `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.23.3"
features = ["auto-initialize"]
```

Example program displaying the value of `sys.version` and the current user name:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::IntoPyDict;
use pyo3::ffi::c_str;

fn main() -> PyResult<()> {
    Python::with_gil(|py| {
        let sys = py.import("sys")?;
        let version: String = sys.getattr("version")?.extract()?;

        let locals = [("os", py.import("os")?)].into_py_dict(py)?;
        let code = c_str!("os.getenv('USER') or os.getenv('USERNAME') or 'Unknown'");
        let user: String = py.eval(code, None, Some(&locals))?.extract()?;

        println!("Hello {}, I'm Python {}", user, version);
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

The guide has [a section](https://pyo3.rs/latest/python-from-rust.html) with lots of examples
