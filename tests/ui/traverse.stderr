error: __traverse__ may not take a receiver other than `&self`. Usually, an implementation of `__traverse__(&self, visit: PyVisit<'_>) -> Result<(), PyTraverseError>` should do nothing but calls to `visit.call`. Most importantly, safe access to the GIL is prohibited inside implementations of `__traverse__`, i.e. `Python::with_gil` will panic.
