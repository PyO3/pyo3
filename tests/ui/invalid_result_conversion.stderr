21  | #[pyfunction]
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `IntoPyCallbackOutput<_>` is not implemented for `Result<(), MyError>`
    |
    = help: the following implementations were found:
              <Result<T, E> as IntoPyCallbackOutput<U>>
note: required by a bound in `pyo3::callback::convert`
   --> src/callback.rs

    |     T: IntoPyCallbackOutput<U>,
    |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `pyo3::callback::convert`
    = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `pyfunction` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
